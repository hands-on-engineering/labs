Computer files are simply data containers, nothing more. The data is often contained in a 1D byte array and. Typically, the file extension carries meaning as to how a program should read the contents of the file. Many file types also reserve a few bytes in the beginning of the file to store metadata about the file.

In terms of how the data within the file is organized, the file type has full control how data should be split into smaller units. For instance, plain text files often use newlines as a delimeter between "lines". It is important to realize that a computer file is very versatile; it is not difficult to invent a new file type, which we will do in a later lab.
